Hi! My name is Aliona, and this is my self-introdaction video.  I'm from Belarus, and by profession I'm a physicist. I graduated from the Faculty of Physics of the Belarusian State University. And in recent years I worked at a research center developing optical materials and lasers. Last year I faced with a number of life troubles and I decided to change my occupation. During my studies and work, I used Matlab, Matematica,  and some Python libraries for data visualization. So, I already had some coding experience. But the choice of direction was pretty hard for me. Mostly I drew on the inspiration and support of my brother. 

He had worked as a web developer and frequently urged me to try myself in this field. So I started to learn JavaScript, HTML and CSS. I found that I loved the creative freedom and problem-solving aspects of web development.

ï»¿I started with the freeCodeCamp course as it offered free JavaScript curriculum. Then, I discovered The Rolling Scopes School community. And since last spring, I joined their stage zero preparatory course. Here I have learned a lot of fundamental things, including how to use git and GitHub, Visual Studio Code, and basic web development technologies. 

Also, during this time I've made several training projects. My first practical task was to create an interactive webpage for the Brooklyn Public Library. That helped me to practice client-side form validation. The audio player. The Image gallery - based on Unsplash and Flickr API. I have also implemented filtering images by their orientation, and displaying some extra info. The random game - one of the most creative tasks I remember. I developed a popular water sort puzzle. After I successfully finished stage zero, I continued my learning journey on the main course, where I have learned algorithms and data structures, linters, and formatters, basic concepts of Node.js and object-oriented programming. 

One of the most interesting practical tasks of the first stage was the Coffee House two-page interactive web app. The game Hangman where I tried to imitate chalkboard drawing animations and sound effects. And the final project -- the game Nonograms. I was pleasantly surprised to discover that my work was recognized as one of the best ones. 

During my time at The Rolling Scopes School, I learned the value of a supportive community. It improved my technical skills and taught me the importance of teamwork and sharing knowledge. I'm grateful for the opportunity to learn and grow alongside such talented people. Thank you for watching this video!
