## Reflections

### ‚≠ê Getting Started with TypeScript
In the first module, I discovered the benefits of using the TypeScript language and why it was created. I installed and configured the TypeScript development environment in VSCode. TS provides flexible configuration with a wide variety of options. With TypeScript, you can specify the target ECMAScript version, enable strict type checking, and customize the compilation process to suit your project's needs.

### ‚≠ê Variable Types
In the second module, I learned about declaring typed variables, working with typed objects, and the concepts of type unions and intersections. The hardest for me was understanding type assertions. Type assertions in TypeScript allow you to override the inferred type of variable and assert that it has a specific type. I also learned about type guards, which perform runtime checks to narrow down the type of variable based on specific conditions. Type guards are especially helpful when working with union types, allowing you to write code that can vary between different types within the union. Type guards combined with type assertions are usefull for creation assertion function and various checks and helpers when using typescript.

### ‚≠ê Interfaces
In the next module I learned the interfaces in TypeScript. They provide a way to define the structure of objects, including their properties and methods, and their types. They can be used to enforce a contract on objects and ensure that they adhere to a specific shape. Interfaces also allow the creation of complex types by combining other types, such as other interfaces or primitive types. This can help to create more flexible and reusable code by defining custom types which can be used in different parts of an application. 

### ‚≠ê Functions
I also discovered typed functions in TypeScript. This helps to ensure that the function is used correctly and can catch potential type errors at compile-time. Additionally, TypeScript allows use of optional and default parameters in functions, providing more flexibility in how the functions are called.

### ‚≠ê Classes and objects
I learned the principles of class typing in TypeScript and practiced using interfaces and classes to define the shape and behavior of objects in my code. This will help me create more structured and maintainable applications. I experimented with TypeScript's access modifiers like public, private, and protected to manage the visibility and accessibility of properties and methods. By encapsulating certain properties and methods, one can ensure the integrity and security of code.

### ‚≠ê Generics
Using generics, I found that I could create functions and classes that can work with a variety of data types while maintaining type safety and code integrity. This allows writing more flexible and generic code that could be reused in multiple scenarios. It was challenging at first to understand how to use it, but now the ability to write code that is both reusable and type-safe seems to me very profitable. 

### ‚≠ê Modules
In module 7, I learned how to organize module structure in Typescript. By structuring my code into separate modules, I can keep my code clean and organized. This makes it easier to find and manage different components of my code, making the development process more efficient. Additionally, by using modules, I can easily encapsulate logic and prevent naming collisions between different parts of my code.

### ‚≠ê Namespaces
By using namespaces, one can prevent potential naming conflicts and create a more scalable application architecture. It took some time to grasp the idea of encapsulation and how it can improve code modularity using namespaces. It was difficult to understand why we should use namespaces but not classes for this purpose. However, I hope I will start soon implementing it in my projects, and it should help me avoid some errors and reach clear structure of my code. 

________________________________________
*Overall, my first experience with Typescript has been positive. But I still need to explore more documentation and learning materials to feel more confident and apply my knowledge in future projects and write working code on TypeScript.*
