## Reflections

1. In the first module, I discovered the benefits of using the TypeScript language and why it was created. I installed and configured the TypeScript development environment in VSCode. TypeScript provides flexible configuration with a wide variety of options. With TypeScript, you can specify the target ECMAScript version, enable strict type checking, and customize the compilation process to suit your project's needs.
